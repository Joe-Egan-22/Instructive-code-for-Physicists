# Instructive-code-for-Physicists
## Library of files which are useful for revision of fundamentals

Files detail applications of numpy, matplotlib and other useful functions; in the context of physics/mathematics. Collected from cumulative experience of Python coding during my time as an undergraduate Physicist. My coding skill has gone up and down over the years, thus I thought it prudent to have a central repository for all of my past projects/learning-files that I may look back on to ensure my fundamentals are never forgotten when I am out of practice.

NB: Requires organisation for better use.
